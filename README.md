# theater-showtime-info
An app which searches for any theater nearby for local movie showtimes. You can specify local zip code and radius to search.
As of the beginning, it's just a console app writing to System.out. I want to first add a GUI (JSP and HTML pages) and then implement
a user registration/login functionality.  A user will be able to save their preferred zip code, as well as a few other options, when
searching for local theater information.
